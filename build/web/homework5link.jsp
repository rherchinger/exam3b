        <h2> Site Features </h2>
        <p> This assignment allows us to add and delete rows in the database, which the actual database would be updated as the application is.</p>
        <p> The delete function consists of a button at the last column of the movies table</p>
        <p> With the add function, you must click on "Add A New Movie" in the main database page, and this will add a new row of data you submit to a form.</p>
